        introduction : "The DragonScape is a worldbuilding project that I have been working and drawing on for 3 years now, with The help of some awesome folks This wiki has been made possible and will serve as a wiki for consolidating the years of work, lore, and ideas for the setting. The DragonScape is a fantasy setting in which the Americas are beset by billions of draconic gods, the wildernesses of the American Continents are enchanted, the wildlife turned draconic, and the humans that once lived in the Americas were changed to the drekir. Awakening long after the pulse, the once human drekir are left to survive in a world that is both familiar and strange. From strange tribes growing from the foundations of initial survivors trying to understand where the world they knew went, to the grand realms of the sivilāo and the majesty of the Balār to the strange warping of the magical landscape around them. The DragonScape is full of many different stories, people, cultures and societies. Feel free to read on to find more!",
